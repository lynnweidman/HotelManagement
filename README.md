# HotelManagement
 with Generics and Collections
 
Changes:

HotelEmployee is of E type. It contains a list (allHotelEmployees) of HotelEmployee type. 
HouseCleaner, Manager, and Receptionist are also of E type and extend HotelEmployee. Each of which can be added to the allHotelEmployees list.

Restaurant Employee is of E type. It contains a list (allRestaurantEmployees) of RestaurantEmployee type.
Server and Chef are also of E type and extend RestaurantEmployee. Each of which can be added to the all RestaurantEmployees list.

Created an interface called Print that is of T type. It contains a method to print a List. 
(Created this so I don't have to type System.out.println() everytime I want to print to the console.)

Created a class called CustomLinkedList.
